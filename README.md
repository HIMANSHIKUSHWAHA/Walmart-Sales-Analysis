## üíµ Revenue & Profit Calculations

- **COGS (Cost of Goods Sold):** 
  \[
  COGS = \text{Unit Price} \times \text{Quantity}
  \]
  
- **VAT (Value Added Tax):** 
  \[
  VAT = 5\% \times COGS
  \]
  
- **Total Sales:** 
  \[
  \text{Total Sales} = VAT + COGS
  \]
  
- **Gross Profit:** 
  \[
  \text{Gross Profit} = \text{Total Sales} - COGS
  \]

- **Gross Margin:** 
  \[
  \text{Gross Margin} = \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Total Sales}}
  \]

### Example:

- **Unit Price:** 45.79, **Quantity:** 7
- **COGS:** $45.79 \times 7 = 320.53$
- **VAT:** $5\% \times 320.53 = 16.03$
- **Total Sales:** $320.53 + 16.03 = 336.56$
- **Gross Margin:** $\frac{16.03}{336.56} \approx 4.76\%$
